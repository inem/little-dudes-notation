# Little dudes notation (v. 0.1.0)

## Motivation

- to help developers quickly grasp essence of pieces of code
- to provide a compact way to reflect code complexity
- to visualize "bigger picture" in real projects
- to see how things change in dynamics 

## Foundation

1. Objects - dudes
2. Methods - hands
3. Parameters - fingers
4. Instance variables - stored in the brain
5. Private methods - "internal hands"
6. Execution flow

## Usage

1. [Example #1](https://github.com/inem/little-dudes-notation/blob/master/deconstruct-sandi-metz-talk.md)

## Flexibility

You don't have to visualize every single aspect of your class. For example, if for your task instance variables or private methods are not important, you simply don't draw them.

The same goes for classes/objects you want to reflect. For example, when you work on a feature or refactor a part of your code, you might be interested to visualize only a subset of classes.

## Extensibility

1. You can use colors to identify classes from different layers of abstractions, or classes of specific namespace.

2. Code coverage, code performance (Big-O notation), churn rate, vulnerabilities, any code complexity metrics can be easily reflected on bodies of the dudes.
